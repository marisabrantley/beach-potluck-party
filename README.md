# Beach Potluck Party Project 

The project involved creating a guest list for a fictitious potluck, then randomly assigning dishes for the guests to bring along.

## Objective
* Use event handlers, function expressions, and querySelectorAll() to create a list of 8 guests maximum to invite to the potluck, as well as clear the input box. 
* Then use functions, a for...of loop, an array, and the Math object to randomly assign a dish to invitees. 
* Once the dishes are assigned, use the disabled property to prevent assigning dishes twice.
